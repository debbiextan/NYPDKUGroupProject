Issues to consider -

Issues 01: Ideate for Android application, what type of application, service or product is to be created and more specific functions.

Issues 02: Create UML class diagram for possible objects, functions and structure of the application itself.

Issues 03: Design a UI with UX specifics, desire a clean, simplistic but intuitive interface. Usage of metaphors preferred for icons.
